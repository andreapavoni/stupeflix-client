# Stupeflix API Ruby client

This is a gem-ified version of the [Official Stupeflix API Client](https://github.com/Stupeflix/Stupeflix-API-Client).
At the moment, I've only took the Ruby code and packed it _as is_ into a gem to get it more usable inside a Ruby/Rails project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'stupeflix-client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install stupeflix-client

## Usage

See the [examples/](https://github.com/apeacox/stupeflix-client/tree/master/examples) folder.

## TODO

* add tests (perhaps rspec or minitest/spec would be perfect)
* refactor code to get closer to the _ruby way_
* add better builder (I'd use 'builder' gem to keep dependencies simple)

## Contributing

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request
